                <h3> A Little About Me</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                My name is Harrison but my friends tend to call me H. I've been born and raised in Seattle and lived hear all my life. Although I am eager to move out of this 
                wonderful city and go somewhere warmer, this will always be home. My dad put me on the wrestling team at age 5 and the football team at age 7, so it would
                be a safe assumption that athletics have always been a big part of my life. I went on to have successful carreers in both sports until my junior year of 
                highschool, when I would get my final career ending concussion in a rival football game. This felt like the end of the world at the time, but I knew 
                I would need to keep my brain in tact for the rest of my life. I'm 24 now, and I still weightlift, wrestlte, and practice Muay Thai Boxing on a regular basis.

                I love food. Although I tend to enjoy it when other people do the cooking, it seems I have been forced to become and pretty good cook myself.
                My favorite kinds of foods are Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Indain, and Mexican. I also love a good burger...so pretty much everything. I look forward
                to traveling the world and trying all different kinds of foods. 
            </p>

                My last and most overwelming love is music. It's been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. I started out playing saxophone in elementary school
                until I found an old guitar laying out the garage in the 7th grade. I bought some strings and started to teach myself how to play. It wasn't too long that I played
                that old acoustic until I begged my parents to buy me a cheap electric. And not long after that, I was playing Jimmy Page solos riff for riff. I later learned
                how to play the drums, ukulele, and a little keys. After realizing I knew so much about music I downloaded Ableton Live and started making hip hop beats.
                I also learned how to engineer the vocals so I could record artists over my beats and even made quiet a few records myself. I don't see myself quiting anyime soon.
                I'm only taking a brief step back to focus on learning in the evergrowing world of technology.
